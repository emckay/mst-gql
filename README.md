# Error 1: Duplicate objects in MST

Error Something went wrong

Message: [mobx-state-tree] Cannot add an object to a state tree if it is already part of the same or another state tree. Tried to assign an object to '/todos/0', but it lives already at '/basicTodos/0'

WORKAROUND: https://github.com/mobxjs/mst-gql/pull/114
